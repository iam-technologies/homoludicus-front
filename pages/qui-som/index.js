      While it was just a TV show, that little speech at the beginning of the original Star Trek
      show really did do a good job of capturing our feelings about space. It is those feelings that drive our love
      of astronomy and our desire to learn more and more about it.
      <br />
      <br />
      The thing that is most exciting about studying the universe is
      also the most frustrating and that is that no matter how expert we get, we are always just getting started. But if itâ€™s any
      consolation, some of the most advanced minds in science and from history always felt that way about space. Even the greats
      such as Copernicus and Einstein looked up into space and felt like they were just a spec in the presence of such infinity.
